Some notes:

- Fuel is only affected by the main thruster, but a new build also has rotating movement affecting fuel consumption. Still under consideration.
- Warning light/sound when fuel is low will also be added soon.
- Considering adding a timer to make the game more challenging. (May add to some levels).
- Available levels were designed for testing and not the final design. 

Newest feature addition (18/12/20):
