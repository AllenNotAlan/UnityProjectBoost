Features to be added:

- Fuel is only affected by the main thruster, but a new build also has rotating movement affecting fuel consumption. Still under consideration.
- Warning light/sound when fuel is low
- Fuel bar instead of text (Feature added but UI needs better design)
- Considering adding a timer to make the game more challenging. (may add to future level additions)
- Available levels were designed for testing, not final design. More will be added.
